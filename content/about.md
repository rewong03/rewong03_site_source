# Hi, I'm Ryan.  

I'm a senior at [Whitney M. Young High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_M._Young_Magnet_High_School) in Chicago who's interested in 
computer science, physics, and math. At Whitney, I've been a member of my school's 
[cross country and track team](http://www.whitneyyoungrunning.org) since 8th grade as well as a member of my school's 
[orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy4Fy2z8jtamz9CylfylMfA/).  
  
Outside of school, I've been a member of the UChicago STEM Initiative (as part of 
[UChicago's Office of Special Programs](https://osp-cp.uchicago.edu) since 2018. I've also held multiple research assistant positions at 
[UChicago's Center for Data and Computing](https://cdac.uchicago.edu) and [UChicago's Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org) since 2019. Some of my 
past projects include work on [XtractHub](/projects/xtracthub) and [d-gen](/projects/d-gen).  
  
Currently, I'm working on [Abyss](/projects/abyss). I'm 
also interested in learning more about machine learning, systems, and the intersection between CS and science.
