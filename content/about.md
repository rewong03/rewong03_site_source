*Updated on December 16, 2020*

I'm currently a high scool senior at [Whitney Young HS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitney_M._Young_Magnet_High_School) in Chicago. 
I've been a member of my school's [cross country and track team](http://www.whitneyyoungrunning.org) since 8th grade as well as a 
member of my school's [orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy4Fy2z8jtamz9CylfylMfA/).  
  
Outside of school, I've been a member of the UChicago STEM Initiative (as part of [UChicago's Office of Special Programs](https://osp-cp.uchicago.edu)) 
since 2018. I've also held multiple research assistant positions at [UChicago's Center for Data and Computing](https://cdac.uchicago.edu) and [Globus Labs](https://labs.globus.org) 
since 2019. Some of my past projects include work on [XtractHub](/projects/xtracthub) and [d-gen](/projects/d-gen).
